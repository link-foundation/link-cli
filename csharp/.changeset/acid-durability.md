'Foundation.Data.Doublets.Cli': minor

Reject complete corrupt journal entries and report replay failures. Add explicit
data/journal flush callbacks and checkpoint only after data reaches storage.

Add an optional staged links engine with configurable concurrency, isolation,
immutable revision retention, constraints and replaceable file/replicated logs.

Support independent journal branches and atomic three-way merge, with saved
merge bases for reopen/retry after uncertain I/O outcomes.

Compose atomic multi-shard transactions with replaceable journal stores and an
optional etcd HTTP adapter, with bounded I/O, linearizable snapshots, generation
validation, unknown outcomes and actual three-member failover integration.

Route immutable journals to independent data stores while atomically publishing
small catalog pointers; preserve cross-shard validation and unknown-outcome
discovery across independent consensus groups.

Add optional portable delta journal decorators with bounded checkpoint chains,
exact logical replay, corruption rejection and uncertain-write fencing.
Avoid unnecessary recovered-row conflict metadata and skip per-row generation
tracking for exclusive/whole-revision serializable strategies. Reclaim generations
after the final session validates, preserving optimistic ABA/branch conflicts.
